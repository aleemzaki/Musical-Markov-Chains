## Summary ##

Create your own sequence of sounds based on probabilities you decide! Imagine selecting from a variety of instruments to make a personalized set of sounds. Now, if each sound had its own user-defined Markov Chain, then you could define the probabilites of what sound is to be played next based off of the Markov Chain of the sound that just played!

Well we have brought this idea to fruition with Musical Markov Chains!

## Instructions ##

First, select your instruments

Second, roll up your sleeves are start completing each sound's Markov Chain!

Make sure the Probabilities add up to 1! For this example, should the Acoustic Guitar's sound be played, there is a 60% chance that the Acoustic Guitar's sound will be played next (again) and 40% chance that the Electric Guitar's sound will be played next. If the Pr[acguitar to violin] (read "Probability of the violin's sound being played given that the Acoustic Guitar's sound has just been played") is nonzero, the Markov Chain becomes illegal (since a Markov Chain's probabilities should total 1)

When all the Markov Chains are complete, "Orchestrate" and enjoy the show!
