## Summary ##

Create your own sequence of sounds based on probabilities you decide! Imagine selecting from a variety of instruments to make a personalized set of sounds. Now, if each sound had its own user-defined Markov Chain, then you could define the probabilites of what sound is to be played next based off of the Markov Chain of the sound that just played!

Well we have brought this idea to fruition with Musical Markov Chains!
